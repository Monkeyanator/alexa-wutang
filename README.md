# alexa-wutang

Simple Alexa app built in Python with the fantastic <a href="https://github.com/johnwheeler/flask-ask">Flask-ask</a> framework! The combination of Flask-ask and Heroku has allowed me to circumvent the proprietary headache that is AWS Lambda, and for that reason, is probably worth looking into. Heroku is 100% overkill on a simple HTTP request, but for future Alexa apps, might prove a valuable option.
